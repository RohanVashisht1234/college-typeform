## ✨ Problem Statement

Traditional online forms and surveys are often static and impersonal, leading to low engagement and response rates. Businesses struggle to create meaningful, personalized digital interactions. Typeform solves this by transforming dull forms into interactive, conversational experiences.

## 🎨 Creative Feature Added

To improve the user experience, especially for long form-building sessions, I added a **Dark Mode** that activates after login. This reduces eye strain and aligns with user preferences.
